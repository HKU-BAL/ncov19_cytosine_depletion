        <h3>Background</h3> <br>
        <h4>SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus. The intracellular multiplication of positive-strand RNA viruses requires complex interactions with the host cell. The coronavirus genome mimics the structure of a cellular mRNA. It is rapidly translated into an RNA-dependent replicase and proteins that allow the virus to hijack specific host functions used during viral translation, RNA replication, and viral envelope construction. The virus uses a critical set of metabolic pathways for access to the pool of ribonucleotide triphosphates needed for the transcription of many copies of the replicated RNA strand. This makes the viral sequence highly sensitive to changes in the nucleotide pool, the composition of which might be reflected in the virus evolution as it mutates. Although coronaviruses have evolved a specific function meant to overcome some of this limitation via a proofreading step in the replicase function, yet mutations remain unavoidable and viruses, which generate a vast number of particles within a single patient, will evolve quasi-species that will progressively integrate the various types of selection pressure that the virus faces.</h4> <br>
        <h4>Among the pressures, the availability of CTP (Cytidine triphosphate, and hence of cytosine-based precursors) might be an important driving force in the evolution of the virus. The CTP supply in a human is lower than the three other essential triphosphates ATP, GTP, and TTP for RNA synthesis, and the scarceness of CTP in the host will, in turn, lowers the composition of cytosine in a virus genome along with its evolution [1, 2]. This phenomenon is called attenuation, and it co-occurs with the decreased virulence of an RNA virus commonly observed in an outbreak. If under constant selection pressures, the speed of attenuation tends to stabilize, but if extraneous pressures such as massive vaccination or effective medication, the attenuation may slow down or even reverse [3]. By evaluating the speed of cytosine attenuation in the new SARS-CoV-2 strains, it might 1) be used as a new metric at the molecular level for gauging the speed of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and 2) predict the resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to new vaccines and drugs.</h4>
